## Architecture vs Microarchitecture

Architecture / Instruction Set Architecture
- big A arch

Microarchitecture / Organization - implementation of the big A arch
- tradeoffs on how to implement ISA for some metrics
- examples: pipeline depth, # of pipelines, cache size, silicon area, peak power, execution ordering, bus width, ALU width etc


Machine Model
- where do operands come from and where do results go
